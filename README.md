# Udacity-CS102
This is my final project to Programming Foundations with Python.

# 1. Store information in entertainment_center.py

For each movie to present, it should be stored in this file following the structure: 
	
	movieName = media.Movie(movie_title, movie_storyline, poster_image, trailer_youtube))

Then, add the movieName into the movies list.

# 2. Generate webpage

Put all the files in one folder, and run entertainment_center.py. A webpage will be generated into the same folder.
